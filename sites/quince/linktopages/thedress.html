<h1>The Dress</h1>
    <p>A Quincenera dress is a very important part of a Quinceañera celebration. Picking a Quinceañera dress is almost as important as picking a wedding dress. The dress design shows the fact that the Quinceañera girl is no longer a young girl, but is now a senorita (miss). The dress should call attention to the fact that that the girl is leaving childhood and entering womanhood, as this is the purpose of the Quinceañera's party. This dress is the key to making the birthday girl feel like the princess she is on this big day. </p>
