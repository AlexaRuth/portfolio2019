    All of White Birch Resorts cabins and homes have breathtaking Blackduck Lake views, because they sit on a hill 25' above Blackduck lake. The lake front consists of 500'x100' well groomed lawns to the lakes edge. The west side of the resort borders the knee high, Blackduck River which flows north to Red Lake.
